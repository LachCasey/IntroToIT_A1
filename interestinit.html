    <p>I have had an interest in IT ever since I built my first computer when I was 15, after saving up about $1,500. At the time I knew very little about computers apart from what we needed for schoolwork so I spent about an hour at Centrecom getting advice from the store workers. Once my parts arrived and I had put it together, finally having a desktop computer of my own that wasn't just for school purposes really did open my eyes to what technology could do. It pushed me to take IT as a VCE course, even though our school's IT course wasn't exactly the greatest, and finishing that my interest in tech only grew. Particularly, I had a real interest in just keeping up with and seeing the advancements in computer tech as limits kept getting pushed and more and more was possible, whether that be in graphical advancements in VFX, or even just how far new processors and graphics cards could be pushed. The evolution of what is possible within film VFX for example, is something that always impresses me, and I spend a lot of time looking into the behind the scenes details of VFX crews. Similarly, the evolution of what is available at a consumer level for pc parts is fantastically interesting to me, as just comparing the power of what was available in home computers over the last couple of decades is somewhat mind boggling.</p>
    <p>I chose to come to RMIT for a couple of reasons, most of them being admittedly simplistic. My father studied at RMIT for his degree in electrical engineering, and initially I attempted the same degree but found it wasn't for me. A couple of years later I reapplied at RMIT for a bachelor of IT, as despite not enjoying the first course I tried I did quite like the university itself. Despite the travel time being a little obnoxious, being an hour and a half both ways, the downsides of studying here are greatly outweighed by the upsides, as I feel that the quality of education and the reputation of the institute are worth it. Plus I can use my time on public transport to get work done anyway.</p>
    <p>I think fundamentally, I expect to get the base skills required for employment in the IT industry out of these studies. Apart from that, I would certainly aim to learn how to best adapt and learn continuously once I leave formal education and enter the field. After all, it's not going to be much good if my skills remain stagnant once I finish the course. Ideally I would gain the skills needed to know how to best evolve as an IT professional, as well as the various soft skills that will be required in a professional environment. In my few years working I've definitely learnt the usefulness of being able to communicate and work within a team, to name a few, and I would expect to be given the opportunity to further develop these skills at RMIT.</p>
