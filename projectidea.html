    <p>My project will be the creation of a phone application that provides game masters of tabletop roleplaying games a variety of tools to assist with the role of running the game, from the convenience of their phone. These tools will include combat trackers, npc and monster information, loot tables, quest trackers and more. The app will be system agnostic, instead of being restricted to one single system, this will allow the GM to use whichever system their group is currently playing. This will allow the GM to freely create and manage their content without restrictions, as well as allowing them more freedom in what they can create.</p>
    <p>Currently, there exist several apps which provide tools to players for use with a few well known game systems, however, GMs do not have this same luxury, with most of their more sophisticated tools being limited to websites and virtual tabletops. I aim to fill the niche here, so that  the GM is no longer restricted to laptop usage when playing. Additionally, the current tools available are often limited to one particular system, meaning that a different app is needed for each game. I would seek to solve this issue, and offer a tool that allows GMs the use of a single app for multiple systems. The market for this is difficult to determine, with there being little data on how many people play ttrpgs, and even less on how many GM for them, however the hobby has exploded in popularity over the last few years, and it continues to grow. This indicates there is definitely a market for more convenient tools for the hobby.</p>
    <p>The app will have several key functions, acting as a database for the GM's preparatory materials, custom creations and player information. Primarily, the app will provide GMs with the ability to input information and statistics for whatever they use, whether that be item information, monster statistics or npc information. These creations can be stored and accessed freely, for use as reference or with the initiative and combat tracker. The app will provide a few common layouts for inputting information, as well as providing the ability to upload custom layouts. Any field which would reference a dice roll would provide a button that would automatically roll the appropriate dice and add any modifiers, allowing GM's to not require physical dice, or if the roll would use more than they possess. This creation aspect will also extend to player characters as well, allowing GM's to have player character sheets on hand. Anything that is created will be able to be tagged with some common terms, such as "item", "npc" and "spell". This allows for sorting and categorizing of creations, as well as allowing for quicker searches of content.These creations can then be used within the combat tracker, allowing GM's to precreate encounters and events, or create them on the fly. This combat tracker would feature a simple grid and token feature on the top half of the screen, with the bottom half showing the selected creature's information. This tracker will show the key information that the GM will require, such as combat order, current health of all characters, key statistics and available dice rolls. Apart from this, the app will also allow GMs to create custom tables for loot, encounters, npcs and whatever else they wish. This will allow a GM to have on hand a custom made random generator for player rewards, enemy encounters and whatever else they can envision. Additionally, the app will allow people to share their created files and tables, allowing content sharing between different GMs. Other features available would be a quest/story tracker, where GMs could create tables and flowcharts to help plan out and track the progression of various storylines and quests, giving them an easy option for visualizing their plans, as well as quick access to edit things on the spot if the need arises. A simple notes section is a necessity for any ttrpg app as well, providing an easily accessible spot to access notes is essential, for before, during and after game sessions. Finally, the app will allow the option to divide up content between different games, so that GMs can run for multiple groups using multiple systems, without getting content mixed up between them. This keeps GMs from being restricted to one groups content at a time, or from having everything they have ever made and used from being mixed together and causing confusion.All these features would provide everything a GM would need to prepare, plan and run a successful game session, all from a phone, as well as providing one single app for multiple systems, unlike what is currently available.</p>
    <p>This project will require, at a base level, access to a computer and a phone, as well as a text editor. For this project I have looked primarily at javascript as a programming language, as this seems like it will best fit the project goals. The hardware required for this project is easily acquired, as I own a desktop, laptop and an iphone, and the software required is a text editor for which I have Atom installed. Additionally, one of the features of the program will require access to cloud storage in order to share creations between GMs, for which I have taken a look at both dropbox and onedrive. This is all the tools that the project will likely require, although this list is open to adjustments and additions as needed. For testing purposes I would like to gain access to an android phone as well, in order to catch any issues that may arise between phone types. This should not be too difficult however, as it will only require a friend with an android phone rather than purchasing one for myself.</p>
    <p>If this project is successful, this will finally allow GMs to access commonly used tools from a single app, removing the hassle of having multiple tabs open in a browser, and having to store most of their work on a laptop or pc. Additionally, GMs will no longer be limited to just single systems with their tools, opening up more options for experimenting with and playing new systems. This app will open up new avenues for campaign management, providing a much simpler option to GMs to track and control everything. This app will make GMing much easier and easier to access, and will ideally encourage more people to take up the hobby.</p>
