To all those visiting this page, welcome! Within this profile you will find a bit of information about me as a person, as well as an idea for an IT project that I find interesting conceptually. Let's get into it.

Personal Information

My name is Lachlan Casey, I'm currently student number s3721527 at RMIT, and you can contact me at s3721527@student.rmit.edu.au. Born and raised right here in Melbourne, my family has been here since the days of the first convict waves and the gold rush, stemming primarily from Irish and English ancestry. I spent my primary school years at Holy Trinity in Wantirna South, and my high school time was spent at Emmaus College of Wantirna South, finishing my high school education in 2017. Since then I have worked for a bit, spending time as a janitor for a small office building in Mulgrave, a brief stint in a rubber factory focusing on rubber used within vehicles and solar energy, and as a stagehand for concerts, which is a very unfortunate job to have during COVID times. Throughout my whole life, I've been what some would call a "massive nerd". My main hobbies all tend to involve some element of fantasy writings, whether it be my love of epic fantasy fiction such as Lord of the Rings, the Wheel of Time or the Stormlight Archives; or my many hours spent playing tabletop rpgs, mainly Dungeons and Dragons but also lesser known systems like Call of Cthulhu and Cyberpunk. The escapism and creative freedom inherent to the genre really is something that I think can't be found anywhere else, and fuels some genuinely fantastic communities around the hobbies.

Interest in IT

I have had an interest in IT ever since I built my first computer when I was 15, after saving up about $1,500. At the time I knew very little about computers apart from what we needed for schoolwork so I spent about an hour at Centrecom getting advice from the store workers. Once my parts arrived and I had put it together, finally having a desktop computer of my own that wasn't just for school purposes really did open my eyes to what technology could do. It pushed me to take IT as a VCE course, even though our school's IT course wasn't exactly the greatest, and finishing that my interest in tech only grew. Particularly, I had a real interest in just keeping up with and seeing the advancements in computer tech as limits kept getting pushed and more and more was possible, whether that be in graphical advancements in VFX, or even just how far new processors and graphics cards could be pushed. The evolution of what is possible within film VFX for example, is something that always impresses me, and I spend a lot of time looking into the behind the scenes details of VFX crews. Similarly, the evolution of what is available at a consumer level for pc parts is fantastically interesting to me, as just comparing the power of what was available in home computers over the last couple of decades is somewhat mind boggling.

I chose to come to RMIT for a couple of reasons, most of them being admittedly simplistic. My father studied at RMIT for his degree in electrical engineering, and initially I attempted the same degree but found it wasn't for me. A couple of years later and I reapplied at RMIT for a bachelor if IT, as despite not enjoying the frirst course I tried I did quite like the university itself. Despite the travle time being a little obnoxious, being an hour and a half both ways, the downsides of studying here are greatly outweighed by the upsides, as I feel that the quality of education and the reputation of the institute are worth it. Plus I can use my time on public transport to get work done anyway.

I think fundamentally, I expect to get the base skills required for employment in the IT industry out of these studies. Apart from that, I would certainly aim to learn how to best adapt and learn continously once I leave formal education and enter the field. After all, its not going to be much good if my skills remain stagnant once finish the course. Ideally I would gain the skills needed to know how to best evolve as an IT professional, as well as the various soft skills that will be required in a professional environment. In my few years working I've definitely learnt the usefulness of being able to communicate and work within a team, to name a few, and I would expect to be given the opportunity to further develop these skills at RMIT.

Ideal Job

IT Manager, Assurant
https://www.seek.com.au/job/56024312?type=promoted#sol=2ca2bdbeff751b66ffc9a81f1b94cf8a39446edf

This is a job that I would be aiming for after several years working in the industry, taking on a managerial role within an IT team. The job entails taking the lead on the development and delivery of various IT solutions for a company, as well as overseeing the ongoing support for the day to day operations of the existing systems. This appeals to me for several reasons, namely being pay, benefits, location and opportunity. The pay on offer is obviously appealing, being $140,000-$150,000 plus super, and the location of the office is in Camberwell which is a plus to me as I quite like living in Melbourne. Additionally, the option to work remotely is almost a necessity for any job I would apply for, especially after the last couple of years. The benefits on offer from this company are also reasonably attractive, namely the employee share purchase plans and the support for further education with study grants.

The role itself requires a range of skills, as to be expected from a position requiring several years experience. These required skills mainy focus on two areas, experience with various technologies, and managerial and communication skills. The technology experience required is quite a broad range, asking for experience with relational databases, cloud based tech, server operating systems, various distributed technologies like Visual Studio and .Net Framework, and API technologies, to name a few. Additionally, being a managerial position it requires a demonstrated ability to manage projects and communicate the technical elements of the job common language, in order to provide updates and work with business stakeholders.

Currently, I only hold very few of these skills, mostly focussing in the communicative elements of the role. I already hold some experience withworking with a team and taking on a leadership role within a crew, due to my experience as a stagehand, though the work type  is very different. Additionally I have a base level of experience with relational databases and some basic technologies owing to my high school courses, however this is not nearly enough for such a role.

The overarching plan for how I would gain the required skills for such a role is simple sounding, but does require a reasonable level of time and effort invested. Firstly, finishing my degree in IT will provide a baseline level of experience with various technologies, as well as expanding on my experience working within a team to deliver projects. From there, entering the workforce in an IT field will allow me to expand my reportoire of technologies that I have worked with, as well as ideally giving me the opportunity to take on leadership roles within teams. From there the goal is to gain enough experience in the field to progress my career to a point where I can take on a managerial role in IT departments.
