    <p>The results of these tests, to me, provide a reasonably good indication of the ways in which I interact with other people. I don't personally take much stock in tests like these as a definitive marker of exactly what type of person someone is, but they can give a good idea of what role you'll fulfill in a team. My results indicate information which I somewhat already knew, such as my preferred learning style and some elements of the Big Five test, such as the extroversion scale. As for the classification given by the Myers-Briggs test, I think this gives a fairly reliable way of working out my position within a group and focusing on my strengths. Specifically, as my test places me as a mediator type, this indicates that my strengths revolve around assisting group members and keeping an eye on the bigger picture, whilst weaknesses include poor time management and being prone to procrastination, due to struggling to keep on one single thing at a time.</p>
    <p>The main way my behaviour would be influenced by these results is that I will certainly play towards my strengths a lot more when in a group, working to assist others and provide new ideas and alternate viewpoints as we work and progress. Working within a team definitely plays into my reflector learning style as well, allowing me to easily take part in group discussions and get feedback from others. Additionally, looking at the Big Five test the indication of low extraversion is something to consciously avoid when working with others, in order to make the most of my positive agreeableness and intellect/imagination scores. All in all, the results of these tests make a good highlight of elements to focus on within a team, as well as elements that I need to be aware of in order to facilitate a positive team environment.</p>
    <p>When forming a team, these results give a very good idea of strengths and weaknesses, which will allow me to form a team that will cover each other's weak points and build on our strengths. As an example, I would look for people that are able to stay quite focused on individual tasks and stay on deadlines well, in order to cover my own weaknesses. Additionally, I would look for people that struggle with getting bogged down with individual tasks and other reflector learners, in order to play to my own strengths in a group. I would definitely try and make use of these various personality types when forming a team, in order to cover as many of our bases as possible, and having a variation in learning styles is probably for the best, although having several reflectors in a team is something I would look for as that learning style works best with multiple in a group.</p>
